# AI Agents Home

Welcome to the AI Agents section of the local wiki. This space is dedicated to exploring the capabilities, configurations, and workflows of AI agents, with a particular focus on the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Current Projects

### SSH MCP Server
The SSH MCP Server allows LLMs to interact securely with remote systems via SSH.

- **Status**: Operational
- **Host**: `raspian.home.arpa`
- **Capabilities**: Command execution (`exec`), Sudo execution (`sudo-exec`).
- **Configuration**: Managed via `librechat.yaml`.

#### Key Formatting & Troubleshooting
One common issue encountered during setup is the "Unsupported key format" error. This typically happens when using modern OpenSSH keys (beginning with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`) with the `ssh2` Node.js library.

**Solution**: Convert the key to the older PEM (PKCS#1) format:
```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f /path/to/key
```
The key should then begin with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

## Agentic Workflows

We are developing workflows to automate wiki management, system monitoring, and cross-platform integrations using agents powered by LibreChat and MCP.

### Automated Wiki Posting
This page is managed and deployed by an AI agent using a combination of GitHub and SSH tools. The workflow involves:
1. Content generation via GitHub API.
2. Triggering a remote build and deploy script on the Raspberry Pi via SSH.

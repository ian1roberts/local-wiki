# AI Agents Home

Welcome to the AI Agents section of the local wiki. This space is dedicated to exploring the capabilities, configurations, and workflows of AI agents, with a particular focus on the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Current Tools & Servers

### SSH MCP Server (`ssh-raspian`)
The SSH MCP Server allows LLMs to interact securely with remote systems via SSH.

- **Status**: Operational
- **Host**: `raspian.home.arpa`
- **Capabilities**: Command execution (`exec`), Sudo execution (`sudo-exec`).
- **Configuration**: Managed via `librechat.yaml`.
- **Primary Use**: Remote system management and automated wiki deployment.

#### Troubleshooting: "Unsupported key format"
If you see this error, convert your OpenSSH key to PEM format:
```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f /path/to/key
```

### MediaWiki MCP Server (`mcp-mediawiki`)
This server allows AI agents to interact directly with the MediaWiki instance hosted at `/mw/`.

- **Status**: Operational
- **Host**: `wiki.home.arpa/mw/`
- **Capabilities**: Page creation, editing, and history retrieval.
- **Workflow**: Ideal for collaborative knowledge management where human and AI contributors work side-by-side.

## Agentic Workflows

We are developing workflows to automate wiki management, system monitoring, and cross-platform integrations.

### Automated Quarto Deployment
This wiki is a Quarto-based static site. Agents manage updates via a two-stage workflow:
1. **GitHub Phase**: Content is drafted and navigation updated via the GitHub API.
2. **SSH Phase**: A remote trigger on the Raspberry Pi executes a publishing script that renders the site and rotates the release.

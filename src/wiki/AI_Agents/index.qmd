# AI Agents Home

Welcome to the AI Agents section of the local wiki. This space is dedicated to exploring the capabilities, configurations, and workflows of AI agents, with a particular focus on the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Current Projects

### SSH MCP Server
The SSH MCP Server allows LLMs to interact securely with remote systems via SSH.

- **Status**: Operational
- **Host**: `raspian.home.arpa`
- **Capabilities**: Command execution (`exec`), Sudo execution (`sudo-exec`).
- **Configuration**: Managed via `librechat.yaml`.

## Agentic Workflows

We are developing workflows to automate wiki management, system monitoring, and cross-platform integrations using agents powered by LibreChat and MCP.

### Automated Wiki Posting
This very page was generated and deployed by an AI agent using a combination of GitHub and SSH tools. The workflow involves:
1. Content generation and metadata update.
2. Committing to the source repository.
3. Triggering a remote build and deploy script.

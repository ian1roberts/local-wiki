# AI Agents Home

Welcome to the AI Agents section of the local wiki. This space documents our experiments with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the creation of self-documenting, autonomous workflows.

## Documentation Sections

### [Technical Guide](mcp-technical-guide.qmd)
The primary reference for setting up MCP servers (SSH, MediaWiki, Filesystem) on a Raspberry Pi 5.

### [LibreChat Integration](librechat-setup.qmd)
How to configure `librechat.yaml` and Docker to bridge the gap between LLMs and local services.

### [Case Study: Automation](case-study-automation.qmd)
A look at the "Agentic Loop" that built this wiki, detailing the troubleshooting and deployment workflow.

## The Agentic Ecosystem

We are building a trifecta of access that allows agents to be truly useful:
- **System Access**: Via the `ssh-raspian` MCP server.
- **Knowledge Access**: Via the `mcp-mediawiki` and Quarto local wiki.
- **File Access**: Via the `mcp-filesystem` tool.

## Future Roadmap
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time Pi 5 status dashboards.
- **Automated Scripting**: A library of "Recipes" for system automation.
- **Collaborative AI**: Multi-agent workflows for complex DevOps tasks.

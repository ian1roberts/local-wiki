# LibreChat & MCP Integration

Integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with LibreChat creates a powerful environment where the LLM can interact with the local filesystem, remote servers, and external APIs.

## Configuration in `librechat.yaml`

To enable MCP servers in LibreChat, you add them to the `mcpServers` section of your `librechat.yaml`. 

### Example: SSH MCP Server

```yaml
mcpServers:
  ssh-raspian:
    command: "npx"
    args: 
      - "-y"
      - "ssh-mcp"
      - "--"
      - "--host=172.17.0.1"
      - "--user=ian"
      - "--key=/run/user/1000/mcp-secrets/ai_ssh_key"
    timeout: 60000
```

## Benefits of this Setup
- **Context Awareness**: The agent can read local documentation and code.
- **Actionable Output**: Instead of just giving instructions, the agent can execute commands (e.g., updating this wiki).
- **Security**: SSH keys and secret volumes ensure that access is restricted and managed.

## Future Agents
We are exploring agents that can:
1. **Auto-Monitor**: Check server health and post reports to the wiki.
2. **Auto-Document**: Generate documentation as code changes are pushed.
3. **Interactive Debugging**: Help troubleshoot system errors by directly inspecting logs.
